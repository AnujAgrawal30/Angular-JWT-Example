# angular-8-jwt-authentication-example
To set up the Angular project, follow these steps:
- Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/AnujAgrawal30/Angular-JWT-Example.git` (You need to have git installed for this command)
- `cd Angular-JWT-Example`
- `npm install` (You need to have npm installed for this command)
- `npm audit fix --force` (In case you find any error in the previous installation)
- `npm install --save rxjs-compat`
- `ng serve --open` (You need to have Angular installed for this command)

This will open the website in your default browser. Make sure you have cloned and started the Django server on the same computer before starting the website, else you won't be able to authenticate into the chat screen.

You can use these two authentications to log into the chat room:
- **Username:** anuj  **Password:** password
- **Username:** admin  **Password:** passsword

You can open two tabs in the different browser and login with different username and password to check.
